                <p>There's so many things I want to say to you at every minute of the day. Thoughts come and go every time I eat something good, I think about how I want to share it with you. When I go on a walk, I wish that we can see the views together. As soon as I wake up, you're the first person I want to see. <br><br>

                    I love that you see the blue sky above the clouds. You're like the candle when the light goes out, keeping me company with warmth and comfort. It might seem like you're a small, flickering light, but I know you can set this world ablaze. Every thought you have is like a star and inside you there's infinite. <br><br>
                    
                    There's going to be countless challenging milestones ahead of you. Some days, you'll win and some days, you'll want to quit. Some days, you'll feel like there's no light at the end of the tunnel and the world is caving in. But in those moments, I hope you remember that you're the flickering light that I follow and that I'm right behind you. The ground you stand on in steel and there's nothing you should be afraid to feel. <br><br>
                    
                    Every step you take, I'll celebrate you and celebrate with you because little or big, your feet leaving the ground is just another day.</p>
